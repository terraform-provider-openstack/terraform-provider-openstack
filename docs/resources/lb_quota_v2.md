# openstack\_lb\_quota\_v2

Manages a V2 load balancer quota resource within OpenStack.

~> **Note:** This usually requires admin privileges.

~> **Note:** This resource has a no-op deletion so no actual actions will be
done against the OpenStack API in case of delete call.

~> **Note:** This resource no longer uses all-in creation, so all optional
quota arguments that are not explicitly set will be ignored.

~> **Note:** This resource has attributes that depend on octavia minor
versions. Please ensure your Openstack cloud supports the required [minor
version](../#octavia-api-versioning).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "openstack_identity_project_v3" "project_1" {
  name = "project_1"
}

resource "openstack_lb_quota_v2" "quota_1" {
  project_id     = openstack_identity_project_v3.project_1.id
  loadbalancer   = 6
  listener       = 7
  member         = 8
  pool           = 9
  health_monitor = 10
  l7_policy      = 11
  l7_rule        = 12
}
```
