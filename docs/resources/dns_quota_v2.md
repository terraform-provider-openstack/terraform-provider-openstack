# openstack\_dns\_quota\_v2

Manages DNS quota in OpenStack DNS Service.

~> **Note:** This usually requires admin privileges.

~> **Note:** This resource has a no-op deletion so no actual actions will be
done against the OpenStack API in case of delete call.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "openstack_identity_project_v3" "project_1" {
  name = project_1
}

resource "openstack_dns_quota_v2" "quota_1" {
  project_id        = openstack_identity_project_v3.project_1.id
  api_export_size   = 4
  recordset_records = 10
  zone_records      = 100
  zone_recordsets   = 8
  zones             = 2
}
```
