# openstack\_networking\_router\_v2

Manages a V2 router resource within OpenStack.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "openstack_networking_router_v2" "router_1" {
  name                = "my_router"
  admin_state_up      = true
  external_network_id = "f67f0d72-0ddf-11e4-9d95-e1f29f417e2f"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 networking client.
  A networking client is needed to create a router. If omitted, the
  `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates a new
  router.

* `name` - (Optional) A unique name for the router. Changing this
  updates the `name` of an existing router.

* `description` - (Optional) Human-readable description for the router.

* `admin_state_up` - (Optional) Administrative up/down status for the router
  (must be "true" or "false" if provided). Changing this updates the
  `admin_state_up` of an existing router.

* `distributed` - (Optional) Indicates whether or not to create a
  distributed router. The default policy setting in Neutron restricts
  usage of this property to administrative users only.

* `external_network_id` - (Optional) The network UUID of an external gateway
  for the router. A router with an external gateway is required if any
  compute instances or load balancers will be using floating IPs. Changing
  this updates the external gateway of the router.

* `external_qos_policy_id` - (Optional) The QoS policy UUID that will be applied
  on the external gateway for the router. Changing this updates the external
  gateway of the router.

* `enable_snat` - (Optional) Enable Source NAT for the router. Valid values are
  "true" or "false". An `external_network_id` has to be set in order to
  set this property. Changing this updates the `enable_snat` of the router.
  Setting this value **requires** an **ext-gw-mode** extension to be enabled
  in OpenStack Neutron.

* `external_fixed_ip` - (Optional) An external fixed IP for the router. This
  can be repeated. The structure is described below. An `external_network_id`
  has to be set in order to set this property. Changing this updates the
  external fixed IPs of the router.

* `external_subnet_ids` - (Optional) A list of external subnet IDs to try over
  each to obtain a fixed IP for the router. If a subnet ID in a list has
  exhausted floating IP pool, the next subnet ID will be tried. This argument is
  used only during the router creation and allows to set only one external fixed
  IP. Conflicts with an `external_fixed_ip` argument.

* `tenant_id` - (Optional) The owner of the floating IP. Required if admin wants
  to create a router for another tenant. Changing this creates a new router.

* `value_specs` - (Optional) Map of additional driver-specific options.

* `tags` - (Optional) A set of string tags for the router.

* `vendor_options` - (Optional) Map of additional vendor-specific options.
  Supported options are described below.

* `availability_zone_hints` - (Optional) An availability zone is used to make
  network resources highly available. Used for resources with high availability
  so that they are scheduled on different availability zones. Changing this
  creates a new router.

The `external_fixed_ip` block supports:

* `subnet_id` - (Optional) Subnet in which the fixed IP belongs to.

* `ip_address` - (Optional) The IP address to set on the router.

The `vendor_options` block supports:

* `set_router_gateway_after_create` - (Optional) Boolean to control whether
  the Router gateway is assigned during creation or updated after creation.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the router.
* `region` - See Argument Reference above.
* `name` - See Argument Reference above.
* `description` - See Argument Reference above.
* `admin_state_up` - See Argument Reference above.
* `external_network_id` - See Argument Reference above.
* `external_qos_policy_id` - See Argument Reference above.
* `enable_snat` - See Argument Reference above.
* `external_fixed_ip` - See Argument Reference above.
* `tenant_id` - See Argument Reference above.
* `value_specs` - See Argument Reference above.
* `availability_zone_hints` - See Argument Reference above.
* `tags` - See Argument Reference above.
* `all_tags` - The collection of tags assigned on the router, which have been
  explicitly and implicitly added.

## Import

Routers can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import openstack_networking_router_v2.router_1 014395cd-89fc-4c9b-96b7-13d1ee79dad2
```
