this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "openstack_identity_user_v3" "user_1" {
  name = "user_1"
  domain_id = "default"
}

resource "openstack_identity_role_v3" "role_1" {
  name = "role_1"
  domain_id = "default"
}

resource "openstack_identity_inherit_role_assignment_v3" "role_assignment_1" {
  user_id = openstack_identity_user_v3.user_1.id
  domain_id = "default"
  role_id = openstack_identity_role_v3.role_1.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

## Import

Inherit role assignments can be imported using a constructed id. The id should 
have the form of `domainID/projectID/groupID/userID/roleID`. When something is
not used then leave blank.

For example this will import the inherit role assignment for: 
projectID: 014395cd-89fc-4c9b-96b7-13d1ee79dad2,
userID: 4142e64b-1b35-44a0-9b1e-5affc7af1106,
roleID: ea257959-eeb1-4c10-8d33-26f0409a755d
( domainID and groupID are left blank)

```
$ terraform import openstack_identity_inherit_role_assignment_v3.role_assignment_1 /014395cd-89fc-4c9b-96b7-13d1ee79dad2//4142e64b-1b35-44a0-9b1e-5affc7af1106/ea257959-eeb1-4c10-8d33-26f0409a755d
