# openstack\_networking\_subnet\_v2

Manages a V2 Neutron subnet resource within OpenStack.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "openstack_networking_network_v2" "network_1" {
  name           = "tf_test_network"
  admin_state_up = "true"
}

resource "openstack_networking_subnet_v2" "subnet_1" {
  network_id = openstack_networking_network_v2.network_1.id
  cidr       = "192.168.199.0/24"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Networking client.
  A Networking client is needed to create a Neutron subnet. If omitted, the
  `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates a new
  subnet.

* `network_id` - (Required) The UUID of the parent network. Changing this
  creates a new subnet.

* `cidr` - (Optional) CIDR representing IP range for this subnet, based on IP
  version. You can omit this option if you are creating a subnet from a
  subnet pool.

* `prefix_length` - (Optional) The prefix length to use when creating a subnet
  from a subnet pool. The default subnet pool prefix length that was defined
  when creating the subnet pool will be used if not provided. Changing this
  creates a new subnet.

* `ip_version` - (Optional) IP version, either 4 (default) or 6. Changing this creates a
    new subnet.

* `ipv6_address_mode` - (Optional) The IPv6 address mode. Valid values are
  `dhcpv6-stateful`, `dhcpv6-stateless`, or `slaac`.

* `ipv6_ra_mode` - (Optional) The IPv6 Router Advertisement mode. Valid values
  are `dhcpv6-stateful`, `dhcpv6-stateless`, or `slaac`.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the subnet. Changing this updates the name of
  the existing subnet.

* `description` - (Optional) Human-readable description of the subnet. Changing this
  updates the name of the existing subnet.

* `tenant_id` - (Optional) The owner of the subnet. Required if admin wants to
  create a subnet for another tenant. Changing this creates a new subnet.

* `allocation_pool` - (Optional) A block declaring the start and end range of
  the IP addresses available for use with DHCP in this subnet. Multiple
  `allocation_pool` blocks can be declared, providing the subnet with more
  than one range of IP addresses to use with DHCP. However, each IP range
  must be from the same CIDR that the subnet is part of.
  The `allocation_pool` block is documented below.

* `gateway_ip` - (Optional)  Default gateway used by devices in this subnet.
  Leaving this blank and not setting `no_gateway` will cause a default
  gateway of `.1` to be used. Changing this updates the gateway IP of the
  existing subnet.

* `no_gateway` - (Optional) Do not set a gateway IP on this subnet. Changing
    this removes or adds a default gateway IP of the existing subnet.

* `enable_dhcp` - (Optional) The administrative state of the network.
  Acceptable values are "true" and "false". Changing this value enables or
  disables the DHCP capabilities of the existing subnet. Defaults to true.

* `dns_nameservers` - (Optional) An array of DNS name server names used by hosts
  in this subnet. Changing this updates the DNS name servers for the existing
  subnet.

* `dns_publish_fixed_ip` - (Optional) Whether to publish DNS records for IPs
  from this subnet. Defaults is false.

* `service_types` - (Optional) An array of service types used by the subnet.
  Changing this updates the service types for the existing subnet.

* `segment_id` - (Optional) The segment ID of the subnet. This is used to
  specify which segment the subnet belongs to when using Neutron's routed
  provider networks. Available when neutron segment extension is enabled.

* `subnetpool_id` - (Optional) The ID of the subnetpool associated with the subnet.

* `value_specs` - (Optional) Map of additional options.

* `tags` - (Optional) A set of string tags for the subnet.

The `allocation_pool` block supports:

* `start` - (Required) The starting address.

* `end` - (Required) The ending address.

## Import

Subnets can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import openstack_networking_subnet_v2.subnet_1 da4faf16-5546-41e4-8330-4d0002b74048
```
