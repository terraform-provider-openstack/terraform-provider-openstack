# openstack\_networking\_port\_v2

Use this data source to get the ID of an available OpenStack port.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "openstack_networking_port_v2" "port_1" {
  name = "port_1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Neutron client.
  A Neutron client is needed to retrieve port ids. If omitted, the
  `region` argument of the provider is used.

* `project_id` - (Optional) The owner of the port.

* `port_id` - (Optional) The ID of the port.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the port.

* `description` - (Optional) Human-readable description of the port.

* `admin_state_up` - (Optional) The administrative state of the port.

* `network_id` - (Optional) The ID of the network the port belongs to.

* `device_owner` - (Optional) The device owner of the port.

* `mac_address` - (Optional) The MAC address of the port.

* `device_id` - (Optional) The ID of the device the port belongs to.

* `fixed_ip` - (Optional) The port IP address filter.

* `fixed_ips` - (Optional) The advanced port address filter. The structure is
  described below.

* `status` - (Optional) The status of the port.

* `security_group_ids` - (Optional) The list of port security group IDs to filter.

* `tags` - (Optional) The list of port tags to filter.

* `dns_name` - (Optional) The port DNS name to filter. Available, when Neutron
    DNS extension is enabled.

The `fixed_ips` block supports:

* `subnet_id` - (Optional) Subnet in which the IP address is allocated.

* `ip_address` - (Optional) IP address filter for this port.
